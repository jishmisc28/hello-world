# hello-world
Geetings!(pun)

This is my first attempt on learning and using Git. The hello world tutorial is quite succint and helps in creating a first repo in Git. I will try to understand and explore more on this topic. Primarily I would want to use Git to publish the tutorial/prototype/poc works I do often less than more.  :)
